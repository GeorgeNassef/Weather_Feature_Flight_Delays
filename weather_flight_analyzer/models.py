"""
Data models for weather and flight information.

This module defines the core data structures used throughout the weather-flight analyzer.
It uses dataclasses for efficient and type-safe data handling, with arrow for robust
datetime operations across timezones.

Key Classes:
    - WeatherData: Container for weather observations with time indexing
    - WeatherObservation: Individual weather measurement at a specific time and location
    - Diversion: Flight diversion information including location and timing
    - Flight: Complete flight information including route and any diversions
